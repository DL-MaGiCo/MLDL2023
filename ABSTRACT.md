<h2>Abstract</h2><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project seeks to address the challenge of Visual Geo-Localization (VG) as an image retrieval problem through the use of a CNN. It refers to the process of identifying a place depicted in a query image by comparing it with a large database of images of known locations.
The purpose of this work is  to explore how the design choices made in a VG pipeline can impact the final results in order to improve performance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conduct the experiments, a baseline ResNet model is initially employed. Subsequently, the potential of recent advances in deep learning is investigated by comparing the outcomes obtained using a Generalized-Mean (GeM) pooling layer and a novel feature aggregation technique (MixVPR). Additionally, experiments are performed to compare the effectiveness of using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and AdamW optimizers. Different losses, including Contrastive, Multisimilarity and FastAP are also employed to assess their impact on performance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results indicate that the utilization of MixVPR leads to higher recall and better recognition capabilities. Furthermore, the choice of the loss function and of the optimizer leads to significant differences in the overall performance.
